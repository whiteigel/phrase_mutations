# How to use
The following code mutates phrase on the pattern that you define.

Create "positions.py" and "phrase.py" files. Put them to the same directory as "main.py".

Put "original_phrase" variable into "phrase.py", put "new_positions" variable into "positions.py".

Here is a sample of "original_phrase" variable: original_phrase = "word earth man...". The var type is "string".
Here is a sample of "new_positions" variable" new_positions = [1, 4, 6, 2,...]. The var type is "list".

Make sure the total number of words in phrase is equal to number of position numbers in list.
